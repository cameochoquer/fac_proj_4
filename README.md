# Wes Ander Movie Data
This page is the fourth project required for the FAC application. 

## description 
This page has a table of Wes Anderson's films. The page can accept new data and be added to the table and the table can be sorted alphabetically. 

## planning
1. create basic html skeleton
2. create styling
3. create table elements
4. remap data
5. create function to add data into a table 
6. create function to add form data to the table
6. sort data alphabetically 

## how it was built

Building followed somehwat from planning. This project required the most in terms of asking and getting help as well as challenging my ability to learn. 
Meaning, if you asked me to do this from scratch without googling, I would not be able to. 
I relied heavily on w3 schools to help sort table alphabetically.

I tried creating table entirely through javascript but went back to creating header elements in html.



## future improvements <sub><sub> or what I would've done with more time </sub></sub>
- sort alphabetically, ignoring 'the' in movie title 
- form validation cross referenced with IMDB titles and stats
- better colour for button 
- formatting/ table responsiveness for mobile (legible but does not fit full screen)
- button accessibility
